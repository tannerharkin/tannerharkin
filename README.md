Hello, my name is Tanner Harkin, and I\'m a programming student and Java developer. I have always loved electronics, and especially computers; but first began programming when I was eight years old. I started with HTML, and slowly worked my way up to PHP. Eventually, due in part to the popularity of Minecraft, I began programming in Java. Ever since, I\'ve been slowly improving my skills on my own, and have even begun pursuing a degree in computer science to make my skills *\"official\"* to the wider world.

However, programming is not my only passion. I\'m extremely interested in computer and physical security, ranging from lockpicking and RFID hacking, to obscure buffer overflows. I\'ve grown quite fond of the infosec community, but unfortunately, due to the (naturally) secretive nature of this industry, it has proven difficult to grow my skills. However, I\'m sure that I\'ll eventually meet someone who can help me make the connections I need to thrive.

```bash
$ ls
```
**Programming languages I write in:**
 - Bash
 - Batch (Windows)
 - BASIC
 - CSS
 - HTML
 - Java
 - JavaScript
 - Lua
 - TI nSpire Lua
 - PHP
 
**Programming languages I can understand/am learning:**
 - C
 - C#
 - C++
 - RBX Lua
 - COBOL (not good at it)
 - x86 ASM (not good at it)
 
```bash
$ mkdir
```
If you have a project in mind, or employment opportunity you believe I may be interested in, let me know! I\'m always open to interesting opportunities.
